# Persona-Generator

Persona-Generator is an AI-based tool for creating and simulating realistic personas.  
It generates two personas based on detailed biographies, personal styles, internal voices, and diary entries from minimal input like a name and a short bias.  
The Personas can then interact with each other in natural, context-aware conversations.

## Features

- **Persona Creation**
  - Generate passport-style bio data (age, sex, birthplace, body type, etc.)
  - Build a life CV with relationships, life events, memories, and skills
  - Simulate inner voices that drive personality and behavior
  - Create a self-introduction showing strengths and insecurities
  - Generate detailed daily diary entries with authentic emotions and flaws
  - Describe personal style and current appearance realistically

- **Interaction**
  - Set a location and communication channel, e.g., talking, for the dialog.

### Usage notes
- Certain input biases (e.g., violent or extremist traits) can cause the generated personas to produce content that strong model safety filters normally block.  
- This project aims to highlight the capabilities and limitations of persona conditioning â€” not to promote harmful content.
